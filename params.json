This was programmed in Max 6, it has not been tested in Max 7, but you are free to try.  It requires a few externals, including [bach](http://www.bachproject.net/home).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease email me at mike@mikesperone.com if you are having any trouble.  This has not been updated in quite some time, but I hope to come back to it sometime this year (2016).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
